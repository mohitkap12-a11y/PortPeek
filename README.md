# MacPeek

**The tiny utilities macOS should have built in.**

MacPeek is a native, lightweight, open-source collection of focused macOS menu-bar utilities for finding,
inspecting and understanding the things macOS makes unnecessarily difficult to see. One small app, many
**Peeks** — switch on the ones you want, switch off the rest.

## Utilities

| Utility | Answers | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **PortPeek** | What is using port 3000? Free it safely. | ✅ Available |
| **DisplayPeek** | What display configuration am I actually running? | ✅ Available |
| **USBPeek** | What is connected, and at what speed? | ✅ Available |
| **NetPeek** | Is my network connection actually healthy? | ✅ Available |
| **BatteryPeek** | What is my MacBook battery actually doing? | Coming soon |
| **SleepPeek** | Why isn't my Mac sleeping? | ✅ Available |
| **FileLockPeek** | What process is using this file? | ✅ Available |
| **ProcessPeek** | What exactly is this process? | ✅ Available |
| **DiskPeek** | Which app is using my disk right now? | ✅ Available |
| **EnvPeek** | What environment variables does this environment see? | ✅ Available |
| **DNSPeek** | Which DNS servers is my Mac using, and do they respond? | ✅ Available |
| **SoundPeek** | Why is my audio going to the wrong place? | ✅ Available |
| **UpdatePeek** | What updates are available? | ✅ Available |

Open MacPeek's menu-bar icon to see the launcher. **Manage utilities** (or Settings → Manage utilities) lists
every utility with a description, what it reads, what access it needs, and an on/off switch. A utility that
is switched off does no work at all: no polling, no scanning, nothing in the launcher.

## Features
- Native Swift/SwiftUI, menu-bar only (no Dock icon), light/dark/system appearance
- One launcher, one search, one consistent compact UI for every utility
- **Safe process termination** shared by every utility that can kill something: re-check the target →
  verify the PID still owns the resource and is the same process (PID-reuse guard) → SIGTERM → verify
  exit and release → optional, explicit force kill (SIGKILL) after another re-check
- Utilities refresh only while their screen is open
- No account, no telemetry, no cloud, no third-party dependencies. The only network traffic is a check you start yourself (NetPeek pings, DNSPeek lookups, UpdatePeek's macOS and npm checks)

## Install
Download `MacPeek-x.y.z.dmg` from [Releases](../../releases/latest), drag **MacPeek** to **Applications**,
launch it and look for the icon in the menu bar. Releases are Developer ID signed and notarized; verify the
download against the published `SHA256SUMS`.

## Build from source
Requires macOS 13+ and **full Xcode 15+** (Swift 5.9). The standalone *Command Line Tools* are not enough:
SwiftUI's `@State` macro needs the `SwiftUIMacros` plugin that only Xcode ships. If you see
`plugin for module 'SwiftUIMacros' not found`, run
`sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`
(see [Troubleshooting the build](CONTRIBUTING.md#troubleshooting-the-build)).

```bash
swift build
swift test
swift run MacPeek            # runs the menu-bar app
open Package.swift           # or open it in Xcode
scripts/build-app.sh 0.1.0   # build/MacPeek.app (ad-hoc signed unless SIGN_IDENTITY is set)
scripts/make-dmg.sh 0.1.0    # dist/MacPeek-0.1.0.dmg + SHA256SUMS
```

## Architecture
```text
MacPeek (menu-bar app)                      Sources/MacPeek
 ├─ Shell: launcher · router · utility manager · settings · about
 ├─ SharedUI: PeekHeader · PeekRow · StatusBadge · EmptyState · CopyButton …
 └─ Utilities/<Name>/  view + module for each utility
MacPeekCore (shared, UI-free)               Sources/MacPeekCore
 └─ ProcessTerminationService · PermissionService · ProcessInspecting · ShellCommand · UtilityCatalog
<Name>Kit (one per utility, UI-free)        Sources/PortPeekKit, …
 └─ models · parsers · discovery · services — unit-tested with fixtures
```
The shell knows only utility metadata and navigation; each utility owns its models, services, views and tests.
Details: [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md). Adding a utility: [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-utility).

## Security model
MacPeek runs as your user and never elevates privileges. It can only see and terminate what your user can.
Termination never trusts a stale PID. Details: [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Privacy
No account, no telemetry, no cloud. MacPeek reads local system information to show it to you and never
transmits it. The only network traffic is what you ask for: NetPeek's pings, DNSPeek's lookups and UpdatePeek's macOS and npm
checks (Apple's update servers and the npm registry), each run only when you press the button. Each utility documents exactly what it reads (see Manage utilities).

## Roadmap
Twelve utilities are built (PortPeek, FileLockPeek, DisplayPeek, USBPeek, SleepPeek, ProcessPeek, DiskPeek, EnvPeek, NetPeek,
DNSPeek, SoundPeek, UpdatePeek); BatteryPeek is next (it needs a capture from a MacBook), then global search, accessibility and localization
polish → signed releases.
